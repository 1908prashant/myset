            <h2>Introduction to Java Programming</h2>
            <p>
                Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language that has gained immense popularity in the tech industry. With its flexibility and platform independence, Java allows developers to write code that can run on various devices and operating systems through the use of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). This eliminates the need for developers to create separate versions of their code for different platforms.
            </p>
            <p>
                Java is utilized in a wide range of applications, including web development for creating dynamic and interactive websites, mobile app development for Android devices, and even enterprise-level applications due to its robustness and scalability.

            <h2>Basic Syntax and Structure</h2>
            <p>
                Java programs follow a specific structure that involves classes and methods. The core of a Java program is the <code>main</code> method, which serves as the entry point for the program's execution.
            </p>

                        <h2>Variables and Data Types</h2>
                        <p>
                            In Java, variables are used to store data that can be manipulated and used throughout the program. Variables are associated with specific data types, which define the kind of data they can hold.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Java supports various primitive data types, including:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><code>int</code>: Represents whole numbers.</li>
                            <li><code>double</code>: Represents decimal numbers.</li>
                            <li><code>char</code>: Represents single characters.</li>
                            <li><code>boolean</code>: Represents true or false values.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            To declare and initialize a variable, you can use the following syntax:
                        </p>
                        <pre>
                            <code>

                                    <h2>Operators and Expressions</h2>
                                    <p>
                                        Operators are essential components of Java programming that allow you to perform various operations on data. They are used to manipulate variables and produce meaningful results.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Java includes different types of operators, such as:
                                    </p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /, %): Used for basic arithmetic calculations.</li>
                                        <li>Relational operators (<, >, <=, >=, ==, !=): Used for comparing values.</li>
                                        <li>Logical operators (&&, ||, !): Used to perform logical operations.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p>
                                        Operators are often used in expressions, which are combinations of variables, constants, and operators that result in a value. For example:
                                    </p>
                                    <pre>
                                        <code>

                                                <h2>Control Structures: Conditional Statements</h2>
                                                <p>
                                                    Conditional statements are essential for controlling the flow of a program based on certain conditions. They allow you to execute different blocks of code depending on whether specific conditions are met or not.
                                                </p>
                                                <p>
                                                    The <code>if</code> statement is the most basic form of conditional statement. It evaluates a condition and executes a block of code if the condition is true:
                                                </p>
                                                <pre>
                                                    <code>
                                                        <section>

                                                            <p>
                                                                Loops are crucial for executing a block of code repeatedly. They allow you to perform tasks multiple times without duplicating code.
                                                            </p>

                                                                The <code>while</code> loop repeatedly executes a block of code as long as a specified condition is true:
                                                            </p>

                                                                        </p>

                                                                        </p>

                                                                                                </p>
